# PassowrdManager
 
The chosen scenario for this project is the creation of a browser-based application that allows users to manage their passwords and account information securely. This application will locally store personal data, such as usernames and passwords, and provide features like password strength indicators and JSON file integration for account verification.


Our password management system offers a secure and user-friendly solution for individuals and small businesses concerned about securing and managing their digital identities. Unlike cloud-based alternatives, our system ensures data privacy and security by storing sensitive information locally, reducing the risk of data breaches. This application aims to empower users with a reliable tool for managing their passwords, enhancing their overall digital security posture.
